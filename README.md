## Project Overview  
This project aims to **analyze and predict diabetes** in different demographic groups based on key health indicators such as **age, sex, BMI, and smoking history**.  
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from **Kaggle**.

## Dataset  
- ** Source:** [Kaggle](your_kaggle_dataset_link)  
- ** Sample size:** 100,000 records  

### **Features**  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Smoking History  
- Blood Glucose Levels  
- Hypertension  
- Heart Disease  
- **Diabetes Outcome (Target Variable)**  

---

## Objectives  
‚úÖ **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns  
‚úÖ **Build a predictive model** to assess diabetes risk  
‚úÖ **Evaluate model performance** using metrics like **accuracy & precision**  

---

## Tools and Technologies  
**Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Excel, Power Query  
**Querying & Analysis:** SQL, DAX  
**Data Visualization:** Power BI  

---

## Steps Taken  
### **üìå Data Processing**  
Handled missing values & inconsistencies  
Created calculated columns for deeper insights  
Normalized & scaled numerical features  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Visualized distributions & correlations  
Identified key predictive features  

---

## Key Findings  
**Strong Correlations**  
- **BMI & blood glucose levels** have a strong link to diabetes risk.  
- **Smoking history & age** are significant factors.  
- Individuals with **hypertension & heart disease** are at higher risk.  

---

## Recommendations  
### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Lifestyle changes**: Diet & exercise for high-risk individuals  
- **Routine screenings**: Early detection improves outcomes  

### **Healthcare Interventions**  
- **Doctors should prioritize** high-risk individuals  
- **Educational programs** can promote healthier lifestyles  

### **Data Collection Improvements**  
- **More lifestyle data** (diet, activity levels, family history)  
- **Wearable devices** for real-time monitoring  

---

## Limitations  
**Dataset Bias**: May not be representative of all demographics.  
**Limited Features**: No detailed lifestyle data (diet, activity levels).  
**Model Generalization**: May not perform well across different populations. Genetics and
  environmental factors need to be accounted for.
**Binary Predictions**: No risk-level gradation (only diabetic/non-diabetic).  There is no 
  Consideration for level of risk or borderline cases. 
**Medical Disclaimer**: **Not a substitute for professional advice**.
